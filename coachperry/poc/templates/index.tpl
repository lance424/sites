      <h1>Coach Perry</h1>
      <p>After coaching many teams and players, I felt it would be useful to create a website. The purpose:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Provide coaching content for players</li>
        <li>Provide coaching ideas for other coaches</li>
        <li>Links to the BEST coaching information. Many links die out, but we will keep up to date. If you find something else that you like, let me know - and I will check it out and add if possible.</li>
        <li>Have a system to allow former players and coaching friends to connect. This system is a combination of Twitter and ability to find us thru this website. Eventually, a coaching newsletter could be produced for interested people.</li>

      <p>This website was started in 2012 and will gradually grow and adapt as we find things to talk about. If you have ideas for content, let me know.</p>
      <p>If you want to say hi, “shoot” an email to <a href="mailto:Perry@CoachPerry.com">Perry@CoachPerry.com</a>. And of course, use proper form!</p>
