      <h1>Philosophy</h1>
      <p>My coaching philosophy: My coaching priorities are to work together as a team, be fundamentally sound and have a high basketball IQ. This will position us to achieve at a higher level than one may expect and to create a love for the game in the players. I will be demanding and have high expectations, but this is within the context of getting better every day based on where you are at. Winning will be a byproduct of doing these things well.</p>
