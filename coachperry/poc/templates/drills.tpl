      <h1>Drills</h1>

      <p>Favorite Drills</p>

      <p>Dribbling: zig zag drill. Offense does "moves" with a player on defense. Finish with a layup.</p>

      <p>Passing: Triangle passing. Three on offense (not moving) and two in the middle on defense. Bad pass/ catch or deflection is a turnover.</p>

      <p>Rebounding: 5 on 5 war. Play to 10 rebounds, while periodically alternating offense and defense.</p>

      <p>Defense: shell drill ensuring they learn proper close out technique.</p>

      <p>Shooting: Create a drill to get shots like you get from your offense, including where they get the pass from. Important to learn and use proper form at young age, and shooting within range helps with this.</p>

      <p>Fast break: 3 on 2 continuous.</p>

      <p>Summer or individual work: Alone - shooting, makes in 10 minutes from outside the lane. Dribble moves, wall passing and weight/ quickness training. With a partner - around the world shooting and 1 on 1. With 3 people - 2 balls, pass and shoot, and keep score for one minute. With a group - play games up to 3 on 3.</p>

      <p>Practice plan includes: fundamental skills from above, teaching team concepts (o and d) and getting open on the wing, scouting (as appropriate), mental side of the game, and controlled scrimmage. When first introduced, a new concept may take 15 minutes total. After that, 5-10 minutes typical per activity. All players learn all skills.</p>
