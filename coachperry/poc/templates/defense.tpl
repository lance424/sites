      <h1>Defense</h1>

      <p>Offense:</p>

      <p>There are 3 basic styles of play - set plays (player movement, with a set end point), continuity plays (predetermined player movement, no set end point) and motion (player movement rules). What will my team be running? Only the players and coaches will know for sure!</p>

      <p>Defense:</p>

      <p>There are two fundamental defensive approaches: zone (guarding an area) and man to man (guarding a person). The other alternative is if the defense is applied full court or a smaller portion of the playing surface. Again - what will we be running? We will find what works and make sure to have some options.</p>


      <p>Fastbreak can either be a primary or a secondary break. Some teams will emphasize scoring on out of bounds plays, others just focus on getting it in bounds and organizing from there. All of the above decisions depend on the players that you have, and each season should adjust based on this.</p>

      <p>What is our overall approach? We want to run – we will Pressure them into mistakes, Pursue loose balls, Protect rebounds and Push the ball down their throats and into the basket, always Passing to the open man. That is the 5 Ps, from Coach P for how to play.</p>

      <p>Teaching is based on progressions. Skills build and should be challenged in some fashion - either by score or time limited. I believe most drills need to include both offensive and defensive components. Plus, it must be practiced as an overload so that a game becomes much easier.</p>

      <p>What about younger teams in the program? I suggest running a core man to man defense with a core motion offense. Each coach can add a zone defense and set plays, to be used for a portion of the game - allowing some freedom and additional learning for the players. However, with a long duration of running the core, our higher level teams will be capable of executing at a high level.</p>
