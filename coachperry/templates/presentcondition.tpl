      <h1>Analytics - Present Condition</h1>
        <p>I currently offer the following reports to teams. If you are interested in learning more about the Behavioral Analytics (BA) system I created, inquire about a free sample report which we have provided to teams. It is a great way to see the value applied to your team.</p>

<ul>
        <li>Single game reports of your team, or an upcoming opponent</li>
        <li>Multi game trend reports</li>
        <li>Season summary report</li>
</ul>

         <p>NBA teams and high level college teams have taken the deep dive into game and other data. They can now use it to assess player fatigue/ activity level, player injury recovery/ prevention, and for a detailed break down into effectiveness of given actions or plays. Again, software programs were developed to put this information in the hands of the coaches. Image/ pattern recognition and slow motion replay would allow many levels of details to be assessed and addressed. Much analytics effort is going into marketing and business aspects of the game as well (probably more than any other area).

        <p>High school basketball programs can now have games analyzed quickly as the film exchange programs have added statistical analysis and shot chart zone break down evaluation. It covers the basic stats that have long been collected, plus a few new popular tools.

        <p>While there is much excitement, there are still issues to overcome. There is a need to validate tools being used, not just put them out there. There are a range of data quality issues, which makes validating tools a challenge. Injury prevention methods exist but can certainly be expanded. This is just a brief list to indicate some of the current limitations and concerns.

        <p>We also have a lot of "useless stats." Decent ideas and concepts, but they break down in implementation. Further, there are areas that are still completely broken. For example, individual defense player ranking. My research has shown that most evaluations are at the team level. This is a high level metric and is also impacted by who is on the court with you. Some basketball analysts have taken a deeper dive, but it requires a "PhD in Basketball" to perform the analysis, and it is still highly questionable.
