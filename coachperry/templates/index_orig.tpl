      <!--h1>We can coach your development team to better performance</h1-->
      <p>After coaching many teams and players, I felt it would be useful to create a website. The purpose:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Provide coaching content for players</li>
        <li>Provide coaching ideas for other coaches</li>
        <li>Links to the BEST coaching information. Many links die out, but we will keep up to date. If you find something else that you like, let me know - and I will check it out and add if possible.</li>
        <li>Have a system to allow former players and coaching friends to connect. This system is a combination of Twitter and ability to find us thru this website. Eventually, a coaching newsletter could be produced for interested people.</li>


      <p>My coaching philosophy: My coaching priorities are to work together as a team, be fundamentally sound and have a high basketball IQ. This will position us to achieve at a higher level than one may expect and to create a love for the game in the players. I will be demanding and have high expectations, but this is within the context of getting better every day based on where you are at. Winning will be a byproduct of doing these things well.</p>

      <p>Offense:</p>

      <p>There are 3 basic styles of play - set plays (player movement, with a set end point), continuity plays (predetermined player movement, no set end point) and motion (player movement rules). What will my team be running? Only the players and coaches will know for sure!</p>

      <p>Defense:</p>

      <p>There are two fundamental defensive approaches: zone (guarding an area) and man to man (guarding a person). The other alternative is if the defense is applied full court or a smaller portion of the playing surface. Again - what will we be running? We will find what works and make sure to have some options.</p>


      <p>Fastbreak can either be a primary or a secondary break. Some teams will emphasize scoring on out of bounds plays, others just focus on getting it in bounds and organizing from there. All of the above decisions depend on the players that you have, and each season should adjust based on this.</p>

      <p>What is our overall approach? We want to run – we will Pressure them into mistakes, Pursue loose balls, Protect rebounds and Push the ball down their throats and into the basket, always Passing to the open man. That is the 5 Ps, from Coach P for how to play.</p>

      <p>Teaching is based on progressions. Skills build and should be challenged in some fashion - either by score or time limited. I believe most drills need to include both offensive and defensive components. Plus, it must be practiced as an overload so that a game becomes much easier.</p>

      <p>What about younger teams in the program? I suggest running a core man to man defense with a core motion offense. Each coach can add a zone defense and set plays, to be used for a portion of the game - allowing some freedom and additional learning for the players. However, with a long duration of running the core, our higher level teams will be capable of executing at a high level.</p>

      <p>Favorite Drills</p>

      <p>Dribbling: zig zag drill. Offense does "moves" with a player on defense. Finish with a layup.</p>

      <p>Passing: Triangle passing. Three on offense (not moving) and two in the middle on defense. Bad pass/ catch or deflection is a turnover.</p>

      <p>Rebounding: 5 on 5 war. Play to 10 rebounds, while periodically alternating offense and defense.</p>

      <p>Defense: shell drill ensuring they learn proper close out technique.</p>

      <p>Shooting: Create a drill to get shots like you get from your offense, including where they get the pass from. Important to learn and use proper form at young age, and shooting within range helps with this.</p>

      <p>Fast break: 3 on 2 continuous.</p>

      <p>Summer or individual work: Alone - shooting, makes in 10 minutes from outside the lane. Dribble moves, wall passing and weight/ quickness training. With a partner - around the world shooting and 1 on 1. With 3 people - 2 balls, pass and shoot, and keep score for one minute. With a group - play games up to 3 on 3.</p>

      <p>Practice plan includes: fundamental skills from above, teaching team concepts (o and d) and getting open on the wing, scouting (as appropriate), mental side of the game, and controlled scrimmage. When first introduced, a new concept may take 15 minutes total. After that, 5-10 minutes typical per activity. All players learn all skills.</p>
