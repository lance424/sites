      <h1>Analytics</h1>

        <p>Basketball analytics is a topic of growing interest. Years ago, finding a box score and knowing points scored, free throws made and rebounding results was satisfactory. Creating a shot chart during games could allow a quick look at how your offense and defense was performing. (I did this with my own elementary age teams that I was coaching.) This is no longer acceptable for any basketball program. 

        <p>Today analytics is a hot topic and changing quickly. Coaches want to find a "Moneyball" solution for basketball. The pages below provide a short history, the present state, and current work we are doing to advance team and player knowledge to gain a competitive advantage.

        <p>I currently offer the following reports to teams. If you are interested in learning more about the Behavioral Analytics (BA) system I created, inquire about a free sample report which we have provided to teams. It is a great way to see the value applied to your team.</p>

<ul>
        <li>Single game reports of your team, or an upcoming opponent</li>
        <li>Multi game trend reports</li>
        <li>Season summary report</li>
</ul>
