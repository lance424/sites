      <h1>Analytics - Background</h1>
        <p>Player scoring systems have been around a long time. Coaches want an objective way to know who is better. Points are awarded for rebounds, steals and of course points scored. Points are taken away for missed shots and turnovers. The elegance of the system may vary from team to team, but many coaches had a method they were comfortable with. I remember my own coach using this when I was a junior high player. Of course, he was a high school math teacher!

        <p>With the addition of the 3 point shot, coaches became interested in "effective" shooting percentage. For instance, while we make 3 pointers at a lower percentage, what is the impact of the extra point obtained from it? The created a "50% increase" in shooting percentage to allow for this difference. This pushed coaches to think at a deeper level.

        <p>The media has helped with this growth by reporting various metrics. An example is the "+/-" value for an individual player. Fans enjoy this discussion about who is doing well. Some coaches will watch this metric to set up lineups. Others consider it to be missing too much of the equation.

        <p>As computer memory grew and video recording became more accessible, software programs were developed to allow film sharing. This helped the assistant coaches, players, and people recruiting players. This replaced many tape exchange programs.

        <p>This all set the stage for an explosion of analytics. After the "Moneyball" book was published (and the movie made), all sports wanted to catch up with what baseball teams were doing.
