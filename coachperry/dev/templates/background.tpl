      <h1>Analytics - Background</h1>
        <p>Player scoring systems have been around a long time. Coaches want an objective way to know who is better. Points are awarded for rebounds, steals and of course points scored. Points are taken away for missed shots and turnovers. The elegance of the system will vary from team to team, but many coaches have a method they are comfortable with. I remember my own coach using this when I was a junior high player. Of course, he was a high school math teacher!

        <p>With the addition of the 3 point shot, coaches became interested in "effective" shooting percentage. For instance, while we may make 3 pointers at a lower percentage, what is the impact of the extra point obtained from shooting it? This created a "50% increase" in shooting percentage to allow for this point difference. This pushed coaches to think at a deeper level in other aspects of the game as well.

        <p>The media has helped with this growth by reporting various other metrics. One example is the "+/-" value for an individual player. Fans enjoy this discussion about who is doing well. Some coaches will watch this metric to set lineups. Others consider it to be missing too much of the equation. I am one who ignores it.

        <p>As computer memory grew and video recording became more available, software programs were developed to allow film sharing. This helped the assistant coaches, players, and people recruiting players. This allowed tape exchange programs to go digital.

        <p>This set the stage for an explosion of analytics. After the "Moneyball" book was published (and the movie made), all sports wanted to catch up with what baseball teams were doing.
