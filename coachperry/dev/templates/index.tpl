      <h1>Coach Perry - A Basketball Educational Website</h1>
      <p>After coaching many teams and players, I felt it would be useful to create a website. The purpose:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Provide coaching content for players</li>
        <li>Provide coaching ideas for other coaches</li>
        <li>Links to the BEST coaching information. Many links die out, but we will keep up to date. If you find something else that you like, let me know - and I will check it out and add if possible.</li>
        <li>Have a system to allow me to connect with former players and coaching friends. It starts with the ability to find us through this website. Beyond that, it is a combination of emails, Youtube and Twitter. I have created a number of my own videos and made a playlist of other videos. I retweet a lot of content from leading High School, College and NBA coaches, so follow me to get some for yourself. Eventually, a coaching newsletter could be produced for interested people. This area will continue to grow.

       <p>Below are some videos related to coaching. I created most of them regarding my approach. If you find some topics that you want to see, let me know.</p>
