      <h1>Analytics - Current Work</h1>
        <p>What I have learned is coaches are most interested in the report, versus more overwhelming numbers. So I have been spending a lot of time creating and improving the reports. While they are good now, there are additional ideas to be implemented in the near future.

        <p>The primary feedback received has been related to areas beyond the player rating and defensive metric. I'm using this feedback to expand my approach to determining top players and improving all of them.

        <p>In January 2018, I expanded the Behavioral Analytics (BA) metrics included in the tool. I have added additional data to collect. The purpose is to allow the rating to point more deeply to "why" a player is strong or weak. As I worked on the overall concept, I decided to match the BA measures to the skills needed for each position. This last phase (position based skill evaluation) is not in place yet. After data quality has been reviewed and validated, it will be put into operation. The concept is outlined and partially drafted. Realistically, it will take some time to have a solid evaluation. I believe the tool will require advanced and potentially new optimization methods to properly reflect the rating that is most value for coaches.

        <p>Time has also been spent to perform early season assessments for teams evaluated last season. How did the observations and concerns turn out in the next season? Again, this is part of validating the tool. Offseason player development and increased maturity are two clear variables that can impact changes in a players performance.

        <p>Other organizations have been working on image/ pattern recognition and slow motion replay would allow many levels of details to be assessed and addressed. This is something to keep aware of but not something I am directly working on. I expect important changes here in the next few years.

        <p>Of course, there is potential to expand the application to recruiting and draft analysis. It is well published the Houston Rockets have developed a system for drafting players. They have attempted to balance numbers with scout opinions. My tool could easily extend for this application as well.

        <p>If you are interested to learn more, contact us regarding a sample BA report for your team.
