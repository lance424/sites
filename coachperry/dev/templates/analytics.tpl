      <h1>Analytics</h1>

        <p>Basketball analytics is a topic of growing interest. Years ago, finding a box score and knowing points scored, free throws made and rebounding results was satisfactory. Creating a shot chart during games would allow a quick look at how your offense and defense was performing. (I did this with my own elementary age teams that I was coaching.) This is no longer acceptable for any basketball program.

        <p>Today analytics is a hot topic and changing quickly. The pages below provide a short history, the present state, and current work we are doing to advance team and player knowledge to gain a competitive advantage.
