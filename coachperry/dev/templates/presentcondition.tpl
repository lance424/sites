      <h1>Analytics - Present Condition</h1>
        <p>

        <p>Player scoring systems have been around a long time. Coaches want an objective way to know who is better. Points are awarded for rebounds, steals and of course points scored. Points are taken away for missed shots and turnovers. The elegance of the system may vary from team, but many coaches had a method they were comfortable with. I remember my own coach using this when I was a junior high player.

        <p>With the addition of the 3 point shot, coaches became interested in "effective" shooting percentage. For instance, while we make 3 pointers at a lower percentage, what is the impact of the extra point obtained from it? The created a "50% increase" in shooting percentage to allow for this difference.

        <p>The media has helped with this growth by reporting various metrics. An example is the "+/-" value for an individual player. Fans enjoy this discussion about who is doing well.

        <p>As computer memory grew and video recording became more accessible, software programs were developed to allow film sharing. This helped the assistant coaches, players, and people recruiting players. This replaced many tape exchange programs.

        <p>NBA teams and high level college teams have taken the deep dive into game data further. They can now use it to assess player fatigue/ activity level, player injury recovery/ prevention, and for a detailed break down into effectiveness of given actions or plays. Again, software programs were developed to put this information in the hands of the coaches. Image/ pattern recognition and slow motion replay would allow many levels of details to be assessed and addressed.

        <p>High school basketball programs can now have games analyzed quickly as the film exchange programs have added statistical analysis and shot chart zone break down evaluation.

        <p>In my opinion, we have a lot of information to sort through. For instance, injury prevention methods exist but can certainly be expanded. 

But we also have a lot of "useless stats." Decent ideas and concepts, but they break down in implementation. Further, there are areas that are still completely broken. For example, individual defense player ranking. My research has shown that most evaluations are at the team level. This is a high level metric and is also impacted by who is on the court with you. Some basketball analysts have taken a deeper dive, but it requires a "PhD in Basketball" to perform the analysis, and it is still highly questionable.

        <p>Any metric has always needed a deeper understanding about what is behind it. How can it be misread? How can it be abused? Is the right person getting acknowledgement? I started digging into this overall topic deeply in 2015. Reading and understanding the current state of the art. I had already used a player ranking system with my junior high coaching that was being used by the Memphis Grizzlies of the NBA. I knew it was on the right track, but it still sometimes missed players that were helping the team. I continued using these methods as a high school coach, but understood the limitations. I got into Krossover and Hudl and prepared evaluations of the team and of players based on what they had available to us coaches. I had to sort out the good from the junk. (Software will add "junk" because some users want it, and will only buy it if their "hot tool" is included. Software options are about sales, not in what is valuable to the user.)

        <p>In my opinion, the biggest weakness is with the defensive aspect of the game. This is the so called Holy Grail of basketball analytics. It has been written about widely and no one appears to have a solution. In 2016, I had an idea that I thought could help. I evaluated using high school, college and Olympic games. After it appeared to be ok, I implemented it with our high school team on a trial basis that following season. It was showing many new things to us, and yet still confirming our coaching senses. In 2017, I further automated my system and expanded my evaluation. I reviewed top players from opposing teams. I evaluated more college teams with different styles of play.

        <p>What I have learned, it is really about providing solid input to the coach. Who is good, and why. Where can we get better, and how. Rarely do coaches care about the ratings value itself. So my focus has been on the analysis report more than anything else.

        <p>Of course, there is potential to expand the application to recruiting and draft analysis. I will leave that topic for another day!
