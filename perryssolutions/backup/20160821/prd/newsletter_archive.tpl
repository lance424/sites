        <p>DECISION MAKING - ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE
        <br>In the book, "How Leaders Think," they discuss 4 frames for making organizational decisions. The next one we will discuss is organizational structure (and data). It is important to figure out the rules, roles, policies, goals and the environment. This includes understanding the use of data. Do this homework to get the first building block for action.

        <p>ROBUST DESIGN - UNDERSTAND INPUT CAPABILITIES
        <br>Often times, a supplier will promise to meet whatever specifications we request. "We can do that" does not make them capable. Gathering initial prototype information can lead us to smart business and design decisions regarding our product. The following presentation provides <a href="http://bit.ly/1dE82ag"target="_blank">set up ideas</a> for Design Of Experiments.

        <p>DESIGN FOR SCREENING
        <br>In Design of Experiments, an often used phrase is "screening." In our approach, we consider it the first phase of testing. Historically, a Resolution III design is used in such cases. To avoid missing critical parameters and make the most of our resources, a Resolution IV or higher design should be used. The following <a href="http://bit.ly/1cIsZQN"target="_blank">video</a> gives background about the resolution concept.

        <p>DECISION MAKING 
        <br>In the book, "How Leaders Think," they discuss 4 frames for making organizational decisions. They are organizational structure (and data), people, politics (and power) and culture. If you have thoughts on these topics, please share them with me to expand our future discussions.

        <p>ROBUST DESIGN - REQUIREMENTS 
        <br>This time we will focus on having real requirements. Does it matter if you have a very consistent performance of your product, if the target requirement is random? Using the core elements from a NASA equivalent process can lead to stronger inputs, and thus stronger outputs from the design process. The following <a href="http://bit.ly/1SYvwIp"target="_blank">presentation</a> provides new ideas.

        <p>CREATIVE BY DESIGN
        <br>In the August 2015 issue of Quality Progress, we wrote an article about being creative while using Design of Experiments (DOE) techniques. It is very common to experience impressive creativity break throughs with DOE. Check out the <a href="http://bit.ly/1lGj1qi"target="_blank">article link</a> to learn more, or ask us for a copy.

        <p>STATS FOR SKEPTICS 
        <br>I often discuss the use of statistical data in decision making. What about the skeptics? I have found I embrace the skeptics. They may poke holes in an argument but that is fine so long as you engage them before the data is finalized. What do you think?

        <p>ROBUST DESIGN IN NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT 
        <br>Over the next few newsletters, I am going to provide the key elements in the robust design process. The presentation link provides the <a href="http://bit.ly/1bciKlr"target="_blank">key ideas</a>. Looking forward to sharing the components in greater depth with you!

        <p>QUALITY FUNCTIONAL DEPLOYMENT (QFD)

        <p>DOE IN MARKETING
        <br>Several case studies exist regarding use of Design Of Experiments (DOE) in the marketing function. We have also worked with companies to create this value for them. <a href="http://bit.ly/1hYYVz2"target="_blank">This video</a> talks about this application. This is the next progression for DOE application after going upstream from Research & Development. It is already happening in leading companies. Is it time for your organization?

        <p>QUESTION FOR YOU - EASY TO DO BUSINESS WITH
        <br>Are we an easy company to do business with? And if not, what could we do to make it better for you. I would love to hear from you.

        <p>SOFTWARE REVIEW - DESIGN EXPERT
        <br>Recently, Stat-Ease came out with Version 9 of their DOE software. The outlier test was moved so it is easier to find. The raw data graphing feature is quicker and shows the strength of any relationship. The user can now include Cpk as an optimization goal. Overall, a nice set of improvements for things that I use!

        <p>QUESTION FOR YOU - IMPACT
        <br>Have I had a significant impact on your business? By our calculations, we provide a value of $400k to $600k on a typical engagement. Clients have said this is a conservative measurement! What is your feedback about impact for you?

        <p>ALTERNATIVE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT
        <br>I have long felt Minnesota is a great place for alternative energy development. Global investment growth has focused on solar and wind.What do you know about this industry? Where are the opportunities forming? Where is technology blocked and in need of a break through?

        <p>UNDERSTANDING VARIATION
        <br>We often talk about variation - but how do you really understand it? To me, Statistical Process Control, Design Of Experiments and Monte Carlo Analysis can all help. But it also takes a mindset.What tools do you use? What is your approach? How well do you understand variation? Call us to learn more.

        <p>QUESTIONS FOR YOU - UNDERSTANDING BUSINESS ISSUES
        <br>Do we have a clear understanding of your business issues? How have we been in dealing with your organization? Very interested in your feedback.

        <p>PHYSICS OF FAILURE
        <br>This technique uses the understanding of influences on product performance. This often includes scientific calculations. However, I have witnessed many engineering calculations that do not work out as expected. By strategically using Design of Experiments we can strike a balance between these extremes, raising the likelihood of success in a reasonable time frame. Would you benefit from an improved balance point?

        <p>WHAT DO YOU PROVIDE TO CLIENTS - EXPERIENCE CURVE
        <br>We bring experience from alternative energy, defense and medical device industries. We have managed mechanical, chemical and electrical projects.

        <p>CAUSES FOR MEAN SHIFT IN PART TOLERANCES
        <br>Much attention is given to reducing part variability, but how much do we think about hitting the nominal or midpoint of the tolerance range. Do organizations even try to achieve it? What is your experience? Understanding this topic is a key to creating complex assemblies successfully.

        <p>WHAT DO YOU PROVIDE TO CLIENTS - CUSTOMER SOLUTIONS
        <br>We believe the only thing companies buy is a solution. Our systems view helps minimize potential unintended consequences. We recognize the need for a business solution, not just an idealized technical solution. Our testimonials show we are doing it.

        <p>DOE SPECIALIST
        <br>For some time now, people have considered me as an "expert" in Design of Experiments. After 25 years of using DOE in upstream R&D areas and teaching countless classes, I have created cheat sheets, key questions and thinking frameworks. This enables others to become experts in their own right. However, I find I use tools in ways that others do not. Who else has created a balanced scorecard for their consulting business?

        <p>SPC FOR EXCEL - SOFTWARE REVIEW
        <br>Recently, an organization asked me to provide statistical training (actually, decision making with data) using SPCforExcel software. Having used it now, it has broad capabilities and is very easy to use for most tools. A few areas have important limitations, but fortunately the developers have been receptive to feedback.

        <br>On February 26, Perry will provide a presentation regarding how to develop requirements in an innovative environment. The topic of requirements always seems to be an important yet difficult area. This presentation will provide a starting framework - with practical use experiences.

        <p>SAMPLE SIZE THINKING
        <br>The most common question people ask us is "what sample size should I use." The only time you know you are right, is when it works long term in the field. How do you decide what to use? Three components: 1) Mathematics 2) Representative 3) Belief.

        <p>DECISION MAKING IN NPD FOR BUSINESS SUCCESS
        <br>When giving a presentation about Decision Making recently, I talked about how teams jump to conclusions without considering alternatives. The other extreme is an over-reliance on data. I am reminded of a Deming principle - thinking first, and tools second. What do you see?

        <p>RELIABILILTY OF FRONT LOADING WASHERS
        <br>I recently read an article about the "new" front loading washers having more than expected reliability issues. All I could think was "I knew that was going to happen." Did you think the same thing?

        <p>ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS  PRESENTATION
        <br>Over time, there have been a series of problem solving tools and methods promoted. We have observed a difficulty executing well in complex situations. On May 10, I will be doing a short workshop through Life Science Alley on this topic.

        <p>RISK CHALLENGES TO NPD AND BUSINESS SUCCESS
        <br>When a new project kicks off, a team will often be optimistic. Identified risks are often limited. Thus, the ability to manage them is greatly reduced. There should be no reason to avoid this activity.

        <p>AVOIDING DESIGN LOOPS IN NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT (NPD)
        <br>A key finding from last years "Framework for NPD Excellence" presentation is related to experiencing design loops. Our presentation at the MN ASQ Conference on April 3 is meant to resolve the dilemma of how many loops is appropriate and how to appropriately minimize them.

        <p>DECISION MAKING WITH DATA - IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK
        <br>The current trend to use data in decision making is a pendulum swing from the "pure business instinct" approach. Exclusive dependence on either approach is less than ideal. On March 14, Perry will be discussing the decision making process and how to create this balance at the Minnesota Council for Quality breakfast meeting.

        <p>DESIGN OF EXPERIMENTS (DOE) - BEYOND THE TOOLS
        <br>We were asked recently by a local trade organization to develop a practical one day training class for DOE. Too many statistics and too many toys to "experiment" with can cloud the ability to translate the tools into the real world. Check back on the website to find out the dates as they become available.

        <p>NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT EXCELLENCE FRAMEWORK
        <br>In March, we presented at the American Society for Quality, Minnesota Conference on guidelines for Excellence in New Product Development. It has now been added to the publications section of our website. Let us know of any thoughts that you have on this topic. We expect a lot of activity in this area for some time.

        <p>DESIGNING A TEST IS NOT DOE
        <br>More and more, people will say "we are running a Design of Experiment" (DOE). A short investigation often indicates they are saying the word and not much more. To quickly know the reality, ask "how many factors and what resolution?"

        <p>REQUIREMENTS - FROM NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT TALK
        <br>As I was preparing for a talk in March, I was reminded of the challenge of requirements. I did some research in my numerous project management books. There is a gap where many of us live.

        <p>TIME IS MONEY - AND MONEY TALKS
        <br>These simple one-month class projects at St. Thomas saved on average 3 months of real project schedule. The recent DOE class at St. Thomas had 7 projects save a total of $328k.

        <p>NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT (NPD) PRESENTATION
        <br>I recently ran across a statement I made 10 years ago while giving a presentation - "DOE can be used for anything, but not for everything!" The point is proper application and problem identification are key. My class and my process are the only places where I know it is covered.

        <p>SOFTWARE REVIEW - MINITAB V16
