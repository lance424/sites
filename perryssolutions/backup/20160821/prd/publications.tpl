        <p>DECISION MAKING - PEOPLE
        <br>In the book, "How Leaders Think," the next frame we will discuss is people. It begins by having a sincere belief in people, then they can make better decisions with their areas of responsibility. For decisions that require your input, be visible and accessible. This allows needed discussions to take place instead of debating a call to you for advice.

        <p>ROBUST DESIGN - UNDERSTAND INPUT AND OUTPUT RELATIONSHIPS
        <br>Continuing the robust design series, this time we will focus on understanding input and output relationships. Robustness is focused on the outputs, but inputs are what determine that outcome. Do we know how the inputs relate to the outputs? At times, we have some science to stand on. Sometimes we need to determine that relationship, with the strongest approach being DOE. This <a href="http://bit.ly/13v1rWG"target="_blank">presentation</a> expands on this idea.

        <p>LEAN SIX SIGMA IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT - VIDEO
        <br>Some organizations have an interest to perform product development with a Lean Six Sigma approach. Is that realistic? We need to allow a culture which can tolerate experimentation and the unknown, without the control sometimes implied with these approaches. However we do want to reduce variation in final product performance. That happens with Robust Design. DOE can be very useful in R&D for Robust Design. The following <a href="http://bit.ly/1Q9pm5t"target="_blank">video</a> further evaluates this design methodology.
