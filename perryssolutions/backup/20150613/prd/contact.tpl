        <h2>How do we get started together?</h2>
        <p>After a brief discussion, Perry's Solutions, Inc. will generate a free "one-pager" statement of work or game plan. It is simple but ensures we are talking the same language and the outcomes are clear. Upon acceptance, we will begin and adjust together as needed.

         <p>The one-pager is visual proof of our commitment to understand and meet your needs. However, we still believe the handshake is essential. It is important that you believe we are going to catch the pass, and finish the play.
        <p>Use any of the methods below to contact us and discuss your needs.

        <p>You might be asking, "Is Perry's Solutions, Inc. committed to protecting our intellectual property?" After 15 years of teaching industry project classes at St. Thomas, and 10 years in the defense industry, we are very sensitive to the value of your information. Include with that 10 years working with the hyper competitive medical device industry, and I understand how critical it is for you. Of course I will sign a Non-Disclosure agreement, but it is the longevity in these trusting environments that ensures you that the signature means something.
