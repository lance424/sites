        <h2>Biography for Perry Parendo<br><span class="subheader">Founder of Perry's Solutions, Inc.</span></h2>
        <p>Perry's Solutions, Inc. was founded to help companies achieve product and process breakthroughs using Design of Experiments (DOE). Research of industry training programs shows they do not address the appropriate applications for these tools, resulting in their training investment falling short of true improvement. The company leverages their extensive DOE experience in product development and manufacturing to bring you an innovative yet effective methodology for all developers desiring a quantum-leap improvement in product or process effectiveness.

        <p>Perry began developing and seeing results from his DOE techniques at the GM Research Labs in 1986. He has refined and tested them in various environments, including automotive, aerospace instrumentation, defense industry armament technology and medical products in roles ranging from R&D, to design and production. His unique insight into how DOE is best used has saved time and money while solving problems in all of these industries.

        <p>Parendo has been grooming a new generation of experts at the <a href="http://www.stthomas.edu/engineering/faculty/pkParendo.htm"target="_blank">University of St. Thomas</a> through his teaching since 1996. He has spoken to domestic and international audiences on the use of DOE techniques including the ASQ Minnesota Quality Conference, the Minneapolis Area Reliability Consortium, and the Society of Cost Estimating Analysts in Toronto. He has consulted in a wide range of industries such as consumer products, biomedical products and heavy equipment. He received his Mechanical Engineering degree from the University of Minnesota. He is registered as a professional engineer in the State of Minnesota.

        <p>From a basketball point of view, he has coached a range of ages including summer work outs with high school and college players. He has learned from top coaches in the state and country. This includes helping at summer camps in Iowa and Minnesota. Some coaches he has met are Tubby Smith, Bob Knight and Don Meyer, who are recognized as top coaches and teachers in the game. Perry makes the most of the time available with his team, in situations such as having 48 kids in a gym, with 2 baskets, by himself - and kept them all moving forward. He has also led about 60 players at a summer camp, helping them learn and apply new skills - and have fun! Teams are recognized for teamwork, discipline and over-achieving.
