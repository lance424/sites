        <em>- Mechanical Engineer, Medical device industry</em></p>

        <p>"Perry was my primary advisor for my senior design capstone project in the 2007-2008 school year. I led an especially difficult senior design team and Perry gave sound advice on sustaining team motivation that produced substantial results. Our team was not expected to complete all the required tasks, but in the end I was able to lead the team to completing the project and going well beyond the general capstone and project requirements. All that the team accomplished could not have happened without Perry's sound knowledge of project management and leadership. Whenever I had a question Perry quickly responded with good advice. He made sure he made time for every student that requested his time and made a solid effort to get to know every project and student as best he could- despite the fact that there were over sixty students total running twelve to fifteen different projects."

        <p>"During the five-year period when I represented the Army customer on the Crusader vehicle development program at UDLP, Perry was an excellent analyst and engineer. He was incredibly professional and hard-working, and was respected as an expert on robust analysis and design of experiments (DoE). He authored and led a trade study to establish redundant methods for orienting the main weapon (which could shoot a hundred-pound projectile over 20 miles), and the Army adopted his recommendation. He eventually worked on and improved many other facets of the three related vehicles (two tracked, and one wheeled). He always had an excellent reputation among the government program office and Army user staff"
