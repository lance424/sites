        <p>REMOTE TRAINING AND MANAGEMENT
        <br>The trend in business has been technology integration such as video conferencing and webinars. We have been using these tools for over 15 years to provide world-wide project management support. Regardless of your location, we can help with training, projects or project management.

        <p>WHAT DO YOU PROVIDE TO CLIENTS
        <br>We tend to provide value in the following 4 areas: Customer Solution, Specialist, Local Leadership and Experience Curve. If you have stories related to any of these topics, let us know!

        <p>RESOLUTION AND ALIASING RISKS - VIDEO ON YOUTUBE
        <br>Our most popular video lately has been <a href="http://bit.ly/1cIsZQN"target="_blank">"Resolution and Aliasing Risks."</a> It tells about the assumptions behind fractional factorial designs. Frequently, these tools are used without understanding the risks.

        <p>DOE SPECIALIST
        <br>For some time now, people have considered me as an "expert" in Design of Experiments. After 25 years of using DOE in upstream R&D areas and teaching countless classes, I have created cheat sheets, key questions and thinking frameworks. This enables others to become experts in their own right. However, I find I use tools in ways that others do not. Who else has created a balanced scorecard for their consulting business?

        <p>SPC FOR EXCEL - SOFTWARE REVIEW
        <br>Recently, an organization asked me to provide statistical training (actually, decision making with data) using SPCforExcel software. Having used it now, it has broad capabilities and is very easy to use for most tools. A few areas have important limitations, but fortunately the developers have been receptive to feedback.

        <p>TRAINING AT THE EDGE - VIDEO ON YOUTUBE
        <br>Our most popular video lately has been "Training on the Edge." It tells a basketball story that relates to how we do our training. Maybe you will also find it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5baP4WINNg"target="_blank">interesting!</a>

        <p>REQUIREMENTS FOR INNOVATION - PRESENTATION
        <br>On February 26, Perry will provide a presentation regarding how to develop requirements in an innovative environment. The topic of requirements always seems to be an important yet difficult area. This presentation will provide a starting framework - with practical use experiences.

        <p>SAMPLE SIZE THINKING
        <br>The most common question people ask us is "what sample size should I use." The only time you know you are right, is when it works long term in the field. How do you decide what to use? Three components: 1) Mathematics 2) Representative 3) Belief.

        <p>HOW TO SETUP A GOOD DOE - OUR TOP NEW VIDEO ON YOUTUBE
        <br>Know what question you need to resolve, know how you can track progress and get an approach that covers likely scenarios. This can resolve the competing requirements that often hold back New Product Development.

        <p>FIVE REASONS FOR TRAINING
        <br>1) Need new knowledge 2) Limited skills but need retrained 3) Changes to what was learned previously 4) Wholesale change in topic has occurred 5) Train the trainer.

        <p>INNOVATION IN BUSINESS - NOVEMBER 29 PRESENTATION
        <br>On November 29, 2012, Perry will speak on Innovation for the Central Minnesota Manufacturers Association. Perry will provide insights into how he helps companies create Innovative breakthroughs in a wide range of company functions.

        <p>ON TWITTER - PERRY'S SOLUTIONS
        <br>We recently began a Twitter site to share quotes from our reading, the values that we have, and observations from our work or our day. If you have topics you would like me to share, let me know. Follow us at "Perrys Solutions" and we can interact more!

        <p>INNOVATION IN NPD FOR BUSINESS SUCCESS
        <br>I believe an upcoming and critical trend is innovation. This is easier said than done. With so much outsourcing, some wonder if we have lost the edge? Will Triz help? Will creativity methods help? What do you see?

        <p>CAD FOR CLOUD COMPUTING
        <br>I was recently looking for a CAD terminal for a short term design project. Has anyone used CAD for the cloud? Or know of available work stations?

        <p>ON YOUTUBE - PERRY'S SOLUTIONS INTRODUCTION
        <br>We have produced an introductory video on Youtube. This opens up an opportunity to make other short clips that cover key points. There are many ways to tap this technology but best to do what is useful for the industry.

        <p>DECISION MAKING IN NPD FOR BUSINESS SUCCESS
        <br>When giving a presentation about Decision Making recently, I talked about how teams jump to conclusions without considering alternatives. The other extreme is an over-reliance on data. I am reminded of a Deming principle - thinking first, and tools second. What do you see?

        <p>RELIABILILTY OF FRONT LOADING WASHERS
        <br>I recently read an article about the "new" front loading washers having more than expected reliability issues. All I could think was "I knew that was going to happen." Did you think the same thing?

        <p>ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS  PRESENTATION
        <br>Over time, there have been a series of problem solving tools and methods promoted. We have observed a difficulty executing well in complex situations. On May 10, I will be doing a short workshop through Life Science Alley on this topic.

        <p>RISK CHALLENGES TO NPD AND BUSINESS SUCCESS
        <br>When a new project kicks off, a team will often be optimistic. Identified risks are often limited. Thus, the ability to manage them is greatly reduced. There should be no reason to avoid this activity.

        <p>AVOIDING DESIGN LOOPS IN NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT (NPD)
        <br>A key finding from last years "Framework for NPD Excellence" presentation is related to experiencing design loops. Our presentation at the MN ASQ Conference on April 3 is meant to resolve the dilemma of how many loops is appropriate and how to appropriately minimize them.

        <p>DECISION MAKING WITH DATA - IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK
        <br>The current trend to use data in decision making is a pendulum swing from the "pure business instinct" approach. Exclusive dependence on either approach is less than ideal. On March 14, Perry will be discussing the decision making process and how to create this balance at the Minnesota Council for Quality breakfast meeting.

        <p>THREE MAJOR CHALLENGES TO NPD AND BUSINESS SUCCESS
        <br>We have seen a series of repeated weaknesses in innovation, risk management, and decision making. We will deal with each one in an upcoming newsletter. If you have ideas you would like to share, just send us an email.

        <p>STAR TRIBUNE BUSINESS ARTICLE
        <br>We were recently featured in the Star Tribune. It summarizes where the business is going, shares some basketball flavor, and provides some client feedback. <a href="http://www.startribune.com/business/131357733.html"target="_blank">Check it out online </a>  or find it on our publications page.

        <p>ON THE RADIO - REDEFINING YOUR BUSINESS OR CAREER
        <br>The current economic conditions force many businesses and individuals to question things. This interview is intended to help both groups learn from the experiences our business has had. You can listen live on Monday <a href="http://www.business1570.com/"target="_blank">November 14, 4 pm </a> or hear it later on our publications page.

        <p>ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
        <br>A special project application that companies have called for recently is Root Cause analysis. We are working on a publication on this topic, as we are seeing challenges for organizations. If you have ideas you would like to share or contribute, forward them to us and we can discuss them.

        <p>DESIGN OF EXPERIMENTS (DOE) - BEYOND THE TOOLS
        <br>We were asked recently by a local trade organization to develop a practical one day training class for DOE. Too many statistics and too many toys to "experiment" with can cloud the ability to translate the tools into the real world. Check back on the website to find out the dates as they become available.

        <p>NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT EXCELLENCE FRAMEWORK
        <br>In March, we presented at the American Society for Quality, Minnesota Conference on guidelines for Excellence in New Product Development. It has now been added to the publications section of our website. Let us know of any thoughts that you have on this topic. We expect a lot of activity in this area for some time.

        <p>DESIGNING A TEST IS NOT DOE
        <br>More and more, people will say "we are running a Design of Experiment" (DOE). A short investigation often indicates they are saying the word and not much more. To quickly know the reality, ask "how many factors and what resolution?"

        <p>REQUIREMENTS - FROM NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT TALK
        <br>As I was preparing for a talk in March, I was reminded of the challenge of requirements. I did some research in my numerous project management books. There is a gap where many of us live.

        <p>TIME IS MONEY - AND MONEY TALKS
        <br>These simple one-month class projects at St. Thomas saved on average 3 months of real project schedule. The recent DOE class at St. Thomas had 7 projects save a total of $328k.

        <p>NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT (NPD) PRESENTATION
        <br>At the March 14 ASQ conference, Perry will be presenting an "Excellence Framework for New Product Development." The post-recession economy will be sparked by Innovation, yet it is full of challenges. If you want progress in these areas, give us a call to discuss your situation.

        <p>NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ONLINE SURVEY PARTICIPATION
        <br>Use the following <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/B8MJCFC"target="_blank">link</a> by the end of March to join in the survey or find it on our website. All participants that provide an email address will receive a copy of the final results.

        <p>VIRTUAL DESIGN OF EXPERIMENTS  (DOE)
        <br>I helped with the following <a href="http://static.msi.umn.edu/rreports/2003/121.pdf"target="_blank">paper</a> published through the University of Minnesota in 2003. It shows the benefit of using DOE with a computer simulation. If you would like to understand the science behind your product performance, give us a call to find out how.

        <p>NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT (NPD) PRESENTATION
        <br>I recently ran across a statement I made 10 years ago while giving a presentation - "DOE can be used for anything, but not for everything!" The point is proper application and problem identification are key. My class and my process are the only places where I know it is covered.

        <p>SOFTWARE REVIEW - MINITAB V16
        <br>The most recent version of Minitab statistical software has a few things to be aware of. First is the "tool assistant" to help coach you through the tool options. Split-plot designs are added for DOE. Finally, they have included a tolerance interval calculation.

        <p>INNOVATION VIDEO

        <p>FDA 510K PROCESS REVIEW - PERSPECTIVE
        <br>This month an agency panel released a report of potential changes to the new product approval process. I believe the core change is going to be in handling "extreme" products. Expect additional guidelines established for clinical, manufacturing, and design data expectations for new product categories.

        <p>BOOK REVIEW - TAKING A NEW JOB
        <br>I found a resource that helps new leaders create a transition plan. Pick up "The First 90 Days" and share your thoughts with me about how you benefited.

        <br>On May 19, Perry will again be interviewed on the Peter McClellan show (AM 1570) from 4-5 pm. People tell me that I am a good networker, and many ask for help in finding jobs. From my experiences, I have some tips that can make it effective and less stressful for you.
        <p>DOE SOFTWARE REVIEW - DX8
        <br>You will benefit most from the new Design Expert V8 DOE software if you use Optimal Designs or Mixture Designs. One common use area that has been modified is how center points are used in the factorial analysis. If you get confused, feel free to shoot us an email.
