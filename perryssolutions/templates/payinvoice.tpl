       <h1>Pay invoice</h1>
       <p>An organization can pay by check, electronic fund transfer or credit card. In either case, an invoice is provided by Perry's Solutions, Inc.
       <h2>Check / Electronic Funds Transfer</h2>
        <p>A check is often used for larger projects. This is for projects that require pre-approval or authorization prior to initiation. For multiple payments, companies will set up an electronic fund transfer with us to reduce their handling costs.

        <h2>Credit card</h2>
        <p>A simple method for smaller projects or for a few quick questions is to use a credit card. This provides you the timely response you need to keep your project moving.
