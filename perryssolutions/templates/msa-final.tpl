        <h2>Measurement System Analysis</h2>
        <p>All data collection assumes the measurement system is appropriate.
        <br>Is this something you want to understand?
        <br>Do you have a customer, boss or process that requires proof? And would third party review help with your credibility?
        <br>Are you too busy to add on one more report?
        <p>Many industries require documented proof of acceptable measuring, and practically speaking - you want to make sure you take appropriate actions to make your operations as efficient as possible (do not over inspect, and do not create extra complex systems or equipment)

It will include the standard numerical assessment and recommendations for changes if not acceptable. All you need to do is provide your raw data (link for data input) and answer a few simple questions about your measurement system.
