        <h1>Measurement System Analysis (Gage R&R)</h1>
        <p>All data collection assumes the measurement system is appropriate. When embarking on data generation and collection efforts, the investment of time, money and skills can be significant.
        <li>Is measurement something you want to understand better?</li>
        <li>Do you have a customer, boss or process that requires proof of capability?</li>
        <li>Would third party review help with the credibility?</li>
        <li>Are you too busy to add on one more report to your list of things to do?</li>
        <p>Many industries require documented proof of acceptable measuring, and practically speaking you want to make sure you take appropriate actions to make your operations as efficient as possible.

         <h2>What we offer</h2>
         <p>We have created a service to help you comply and to help you improve your measurement operations. When you provide the necessary inputs, we will create a report for your records. It will include the standard numerical assessment and recommendations for changes if the measurement system is not acceptable. All you need to do is provide your raw data and answer a few simple questions about your measurement system. The steps for you are:

        <p>
        <p>This offer is only for variables data, and non-destructive test results. Attribute data (such as pass/ fail) and destructive testing are a special case thus are not standardized. We can address them as a project on a case by case basis. Typical Gage R&R testing has one fixture, 2-3 operators, 3 trials and 10 parts. This offer is valid for up to 6 operators, up to 5 trials and up to 20 parts. If you desire more than these levels, we can discuss alternatives for your data collection and analysis.
