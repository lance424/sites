        <p>You can choose from three core product development services: Solving new product challenges, assembling active product development teams, and training personnel for New Product Development.</p>
       &nbsp

       <h2>What do we do</h2>
       <p>Working with you, we quickly evaluate options and perform the critical analysis to narrow to the best solution. This includes creating plans to understand how a product works and to identify root causes. The earlier this work is performed the better, including in start-up organizations. For short projects this has consistently saved months on the project schedule and shaved years for larger projects. There is a corresponding cost savings as well as the schedule benefit. It creates a dual benefit of reduced development costs as well as the true production costs reflected in inspection, rejection and returns.<p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
       <p>Most companies could use more experienced problem solvers. If a capable one exists, that person is often not available either because they are too busy or because they work in another department. The ability to perform risk analysis, develop test strategy and provide timely solutions are vital for organizations. Many companies could benefit from a resource who can resolve competing requirements, address a persistent yield concern and improve through put. Our typical project provides a benefit of $600k and the same is possible for your project.
        <p>In a recent situation, we guided a company though an <a href="<?php echo ${env} ?>playbook-project.php">"impossible project"</a>. Several times questions came up about cutting the project. Even though the technology advance would be an important change for customers, maybe this idea was not realistic. Early on, after simplifying the measurement process, we recommended a redesign which solved critical performance concerns (in one case, a 40% performance improvement). Later, manufacturing concerns were studied and addressed with process adjustments and more design modifications. Our work continued to quickly optimize the new features. The project is now considered a success technically and from a market perspective. Do you need a confident and timely solution or root cause analysis?</p>

        <p>Is your <a href="<?php echo ${env} ?>msa.php">measurement system acceptable for your situation?</a> You can quickly obtain the answer.



        <h2>Program management</h2>
        <p>Sometimes an organization will have a new idea for a product offering and they need a new team to help pull it together. How do you find a team of people who can work together, who you can be confident in and can be assembled in a short period of time? During these periods of focused design work, we can create a <a href="<?php echo ${env} ?>playbook-program.php">temporary team</a> using your people and our expert network. Focus is on the outcome of the program and creating a market success.
        <p>We have developed and coached teams in multiple environments while creating product development speed records in several of them. Once a three year project was completed in 1 1/2 years. Another time an 18 month project was finished in 11 months (while also cleaning up an old project to improve manufacturability). In a third project, we virtually eliminated field issues on a new product release using FMEA and test strategy techniques at start of a project. In each case, team morale was high and requirements were met, including cost targets. Would that be a great end result for your next project?</p>


        <h2>Training</h2>
        <p>Companies need <a href="<?php echo ${env} ?>playbook-training.php">training</a> and work related coaching with applicable information, efficiency and practical implementation. Often times training leaves a huge gap between presentation and reality. Some will use toys to teach, which may be fun, but it does not bridge the gap to practical application. Real projects and real data bring the concepts to reality and allows comfort when dealing with new situations.
        <p>The focus of all classes is on decision making, and understanding when to use the right tool at the right time. As an example, through our training, we have coached over 223 DOE projects and saved an estimated $9,193,400 (not including 10 outliers that were considered "too high", which would more than double the savings). This means a class of 10 people can create a $400k benefit for your organization during the training! How would that impact you with your next training class?</p>
