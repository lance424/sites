        <p>We offer three main services: Solving new product challenges, assembling active product development teams, and training personnel for New Product Development.</p>
       &nbsp

       <h2>What do we do</h2>
       <p>We quickly evaluate options and perform the critical analysis to narrow to the best solution. We create plans to understand how a product works and to identify root causes. The earlier we are involved the better, including in start-up organizations. Even for short projects we have saved months on the project schedule and years for larger projects. There is a corresponding cost savings as well as the schedule benefit. We help reduce development costs as well as the true production costs reflected in inspection, rejection and returns.<p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
       <p>Most companies could use more experienced problem solvers. If they have a capable one, that person is not always available either because they are too busy or because they work in another department. Abilities to perform risk analysis, develop test strategy and provide timely solutions are vital for organizations. Many companies could benefit from a resource who can meet competing requirements, address a persistent yield concern and improve through put. Our typical project provides a benefit of $600k and we can do the same for your project.
        <p>In a recent project, we provided support for a company's <a href="<?php echo ${env} ?>playbook-project.php">"impossible project"</a>. Several times questions came up about cutting the project. Even though the technology advance would be an important change for customers, maybe this idea was not realistic. At one point, we recommended a redesign which solved performance concerns. Later, manufacturing concerns were studied and addressed with process adjustments and other design changes. Our work continued to quickly optimize the new features. The project is now considered a success technically and from a market perspective.</p>

        <p>We can also help you <a href="<?php echo ${env} ?>msa.php">evaluate your measurement system capability</a>.



        <h2>Program management</h2>
        <p>Sometimes an organization will have a new idea for a first or next phase product offering and they need a new team to help pull it together. How do you find a team of people who can work together, who you can be confident in and be assembled in a short period of time? During these periods of focused design work, we can create a <a href="<?php echo ${env} ?>playbook-program.php">temporary team</a> (internal and external members) using our expert network. Focus is on the outcome of the program, not just on the deliverable outputs.
        <p>We have developed and coached teams in multiple environments who have created product development speed records. Once a three year project was completed in 1 1/2 years. Another time an 18 month project was finished in 11 months (while also cleaning up an old project to improve manufacturability).</p>

        <h2>Training</h2>
        <p>Companies need <a href="<?php echo ${env} ?>playbook-training.php">training</a> and work related coaching with efficiency, applicable information and practical implementation. Often times training leaves a huge gap between lecture and reality. Some will use toys to teach, which may be fun, but it does not bridge the gap to practical application.
        <p>Through our training, we have coached over 223 DOE projects and saved an estimated $9,193,400 (not including 10 outliers that were considered "too high", which would more than double the savings). This means a class of 10 people can create a $400k benefit for your organization during the training!</p>
